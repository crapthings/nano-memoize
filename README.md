# Faster than fast, smaller than micro ... nano-memoizer.

# Introduction

The devs [caiogondim](https://github.com/caiogondim) and [planttheidea](https://github.com/planttheidea) have produced great memoizers. We analyzed their code to see if we could build something faster than [fast-memoize](https://github.com/caiogondim/fastmemoize.js) and smaller than [micro-memoize](https://github.com/planttheidea/micromemoize) while adding back some of the functionality of [moize](https://github.com/planttheidea/moize) removed in micro-memoize. We think we have done it ... but credit to them ... we just merged the best ideas in both and eliminated excess code.

The minified/gzipped size is 872 bytes for `nano-memoize` vs 959 bytes for `micro-memoize`. And, `nano-memoize` has slightly more functionality.

The speed tests are below.

`fast-memoize` is only the fastest in one case, single argument functions taking an object. However, in the case of a single primitve argument `nano-memoize` is 240% faster.
In all other cases, `fast-memoize` is the slowest of all memoizers tested. We have submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/caiogondim/fast-memoize.js/pull/65) that doubles the speed of 
fast-memoize for single primitive argument functions, but nano-memoize is still faster. When fast-memoize is updated, these benchmarks will also get updated.

`micro-memoize` is faster than `fast-memoize` except for single argument functions.

`nano-memoize` is always faster than `moize`.

`nano-memoize` and `micro-memoize` are comparable and within each others margin of error for multiple-argument functions.

We have found that benchmarks can vary dramartically from O/S to O/S or node version to node version. These tests were run on a Windows 10 64bit 2.4gx machine with 8GB RAM and Node v9.4.0.

We were puzzled about the multiple argument performance on `fast-memoize` given its stated goal of being the "fastest possible". We discovered that the default caching and serialization approach used by fast-memoize only performs well for single argument functions for two reasons:

1) It uses `JSON.stringify` to create a key for an entire argument list. This can be slow.

2) Because a single key is generated for all arguments when perhaps only the first argument differs in a call, a lot of extra work is done. The `moize` and `micro-memoize` approach adopted by `nano-memoize` is far faster for multiple arguments.

Along the way we also discovered that fast-memoize is subject to a key generation risk on edge case functions and fixed the flaw. The fork is [here](https://github.com/anywhichway/fastmemoize.js). We have submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/caiogondim/fast-memoize.js/pull/65). See this [Medium article](https://codeburst.io/akeytokeyswhenjavascriptkeysdontmatchab44c81adc87) for details. 


# Usage

npm install nano-memoize

use the code in the `browser` directory for the browser

Since most devs are running a build pipeline, the code is not transpiled, although it is browserified


# API

The API is a subset of the `moize` API.

```javascript
const memoized = micromemoize(sum(a,b) => a + b);
memoized(1,2); // 3
memoized(1,2); // pulled from cache
```

`memoized(function,options) returns function`

The shape of options is:

```javascript
{
  maxArgs: number, // only use the provided maxArgs for cache look-up, useful for ignoring final callback arguments
  maxAge: number, // number of milliseconds to cache a result
  serializer: function, // the serializer/key generator to use for single argument functions (multi-argument functions do not use a serializer)
  equals: function, // the equals function to use for multi-argument functions, e.g. deepEquals for objects (single-argument functions use serializer not equals)
  vargs: boolean // forces the use of multi-argument paradigm, auto set if function has a spread argument or uses `arguments` in its body.
}
```
